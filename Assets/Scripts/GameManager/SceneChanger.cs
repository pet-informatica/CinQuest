/// <summary>
/// This script is responsible for changing from one scene to another, making a FadeIn/FadeOut effect
///	in the process.
///
///	How to use it: Create a prefab with a single BoxCollider2D and attach the script to it. Fill the "destinyScene" variable
///	name with the scene you want to go, and name the prefab with exactly the same name. This is important. Then, created a new empty
///	gameobject, name it "Spawn" and set it as children of the SceneChanger main prefab. Change the position of the "Spawn
///	for setting exaclty where the player will appear when he get's back for this scene. It's generally in front on the
///	doors. But be careful not to put it too close for the SceneChanger main prefab BoxCollider2D, because if it happens
///	the player will most likely trigger it as soon as he appears in the scene, and we don't want this!
///
///	*If there are more than one object that transports you for other same scene, for example, the 4 stairs in the Cin
///	that both transports you to the Cin second floor, we must have a way to differ between those objects when getting back
///	to the Cin first floor. If it happens, fill the "SpecificName" field naming, for exemple, CinSecondFloor_1, ..., 
///	CinSecondFloor_4, and name the prefabs according to this. Otherwise, leave it empty.
///
///	*Please see the PlayerSpawn script for more information.

/// This script is responsible for keeping track of the player positions when it is changing between scenes.
///	For example: you are in the Cin, and the you enter a teacher room. The game scene will change from Cin to Room.
///	When you leave the room, you obviously wanna get back in front of the Room door in the Cin. But this is not
///	going to happen, because the player will be teleported for the position he is originally set up in the scene. So,
///	when changing scenes, you save the name of the scene you are leaving. Then, when you enter the new scene, it searchs
///	for any "SceneChanger" object that is named like your leavingScene, get it's children object named "Spawn", wich must
//	be positioned on the position you want the player to spawn and teleport the player to it.
///
///	How to use it: It must be attached to the GameManager prefab.

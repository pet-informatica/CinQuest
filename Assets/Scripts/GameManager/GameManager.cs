/// The GameManager is a prefab responsible for storing information about
///	all the quests and overall game progress. To do it, we call DontDestroyOnLoad() for
///	keeping it alive across the scenes. However, there must never be more than one instance
///	of the GameManager on the game, that's why we make it be a singleton. A singleton is an object
///	that is instantiated once the game starts, and then never again.
///
///	The GameManager is also responsible for activating and disabling some children objects, such as the Minimap,
///	the PauseMenuUI, the QuestManagerUI and the InventoryUI. For that, you have a list of string called "diableChildrenInScene".
///	You must populate it with the name of every scene that those object mustn't be present, such as the initial menu, and the game
///	manager will disable them in these scenes. Of course, you must also populate the "childrenObjets" list for the game manager
///	to know wich object he must keep track and diable/enable between scenes.
///
///	How to use it: Attach it to the GameManger prefab. But you can't just drag the GameManager prefab on the scenes, because of it's
///	singleton behavior. You have to instantiate him on the first scenes, but using a script, the so called Loader.
///	*See the Loader script for more information
